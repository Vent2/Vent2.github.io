    So I create my Rails project trying to build of what I made for Sinatra because this is one project I do want people to   use. For this project I wanted the user (resources :user is very helpful when you don't want to type out all the individual routes) to be able to singup with their own username and password(thanks BCrypt) or via Facebook. Thanks to gem 'omniauth' & gem 'omniauth-facebook' I want to add other options on a later date. At this point the user would be at their homepage where they can keep track of their raves or add a new one. I used partials which helped keep the new and edit page DRY. I used form_with in my partials. In the create page you will be able to give your rave a name, price, and date for now. Afterwords at the raves show page you can see the current rave and even add a DJ with a Stage number. You can also check out all the raves made by other users but you wont be able to change them. Even though I enjoyed it, it was a challenging project that I had to push myself to learn alot but thats where all the fun is. Now onto JavaScript.
