My first project for Flatiron and in general since I am a beginner coder. The road getting here with the lessons learned from the labs was a confusing but exciting at the same time. I had to use CLI, which stands for command line interface to scrape a website. Scraping extracts the  data from a  target website.

Going into this project I was extremely stress to say the least. Having fallen behind on the labs because of personal issues and then trying to catch up. That was a struggle for me because I didn’t want to burden my fellow cohorts by asking for help since I knew they had to be stressing with starting their project. Lucky for me I have amazing people in the cohort who reached out on their own accord to help.

So now after getting caught up somewhat (I’ll have to go back to do some labs) I had to choose what I wanted to scrape for my first project. I ended up choosing Audible for this project being that I love reading books ( and at the same time always struggled with writing). About two years ago I learned that I also enjoy hearing the books being narrated. Especially in my early mornings to work, I had a routine of instead of hearing music I would listen to a book on my  drive to and from work.

By this time I watched video guideline about two times and installed Bundle on my terminal about three times. Always starting over because it just wasn’t working for me like the video showed. I’ll admit this took a lot longer then I would like especially already being strapped for time. I am thankful to Chris my cohort lead for helping me out at this point so now I could officially begin.

I knew that I wanted my first scrape to return to me a list of the top Sci-Fi series with the url to these series. At this point I got stuck  once again because of the urls. The name was simple enough but when I tried scraping  the url I would get nil. It took many hours with multiple cohorts to try and figure out why it was happening.  I am grateful for the effort in this but even though we came out blank. Once again though I must thank Chris for helping me figure out that the url I was trying to grab wasn’t available
 In the scope I was trying to grab it from. I had to go more broad because this website put the series in rows of three. So I would get three at a time which means I had to go back and get the titles the same way.
 
After getting through that problem I moved into the second scope. Which I must admit it was so much easier than the first. This part didn’t really take to much of my time. 

Last I had to put it all together and make the menu. This part although a bit confusing was the funniest part. Figuring out the logic to make this whole app run.

Although simple for my first time that allows you to choose a series and get a summary, the price to the first book and a link to take you there. It is mine and I am proud of it. Just a month ago I had very little knowledge when it comes to programming to now building a simple project. I do plan to come back to it and add functionality to it maybe add some aesthetic to make it visually appealing.
