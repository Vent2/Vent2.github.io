Since my high school days I have been interested in technology and what it is able to do. My fascination began when I started working for the schoolâ€™s video production program. There I was to record events and edit the videos including animations, which was my favorite part. It was satisfying to see the end results of what I worked hard to produce.

However, after high school I wanted to mature and understand myself better so I joined the army. Throughout my time in the army I experienced various different things and met many people. As I was getting closer to ending that chapter in my life I had to really think what I wanted to do after. With everything that I learned, thorough research, and the stories of what software engineers were able to create made me want to rekindle my old passion in this way.

Technology is ever-growing and the possibilities are endless. Seeing some of the things that is possible with programming it is almost like magic. I recently read an article about an uncle that programmed a glove for his deaf niece which translates in real time her sign language. This glove helps this girl communicate easier and I think that is beautiful. I strive to one day create something that will be able to help many people.([Link to article](http://thisisafrica.me/africans-rising/roy-allela-bridges-language-barrier-with-sign-language-glove-translator/))
